## 📚 THEORY

- **LEDs and LASER diodes** are commonly used sources in optical communication systems for both digital and analog transmission.
- A **linear electrical-to-optical converter** is essential for intensity modulation and high-quality analog transmission.
- LEDs exhibit a **linear optical output** with respect to forward current within a specific operating range.
